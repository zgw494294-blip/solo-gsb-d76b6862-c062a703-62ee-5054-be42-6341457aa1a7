"""Locate a segment by absolute program time.

Program time enters a playlist through ``#EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME`` (PDT)
tags: every such tag anchors the start of the segment immediately following
it. All times are normalized to UTC and represented internally as *exact*
decimal POSIX timestamps (seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z), so no binary
floating point is ever involved in the date arithmetic.

Program time is only propagated inside one discontinuity region: a segment's
UTC start is derived from the nearest anchor within the same contiguous
sequence run sharing a discontinuity counter by adding/subtracting the exact
decimal ``EXTINF`` durations. Time is never carried across an
``#EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY`` boundary.

A discontinuity counter value is *not* a unique region identifier: across
non-overlapping snapshots the same counter may recur in a later, separate
sequence run. Anchors are therefore attributed to the contiguous run that
actually contains their sequence, never keyed by the counter value alone, so
two runs that happen to reuse a counter are validated and extrapolated
independently.
