"""Intersect the known program-time coverage of two live media playlists.

Each stream is processed independently with the exact same rules as
``/v1/locate``: snapshots are merged by media sequence,
``#EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME`` anchors are validated and normalized to UTC, and
program time is extrapolated with exact decimal ``EXTINF`` durations inside
one contiguous discontinuity run only. Unanchored runs have no known time;
their gaps can never be filled from another time range or from the other
stream.

Only segments whose program time is known in *both* streams participate.
Every such segment is a half-open UTC range ``[start_at, end_at)``; the
common timeline is the pairwise intersection of those ranges. When the two
streams cut at different boundaries, each actually overlapping pair of
segments is emitted separately (boundaries on both sides are split), and
zero-length intersections are dropped.

If the known-time ranges of *different discontinuity runs within one stream*
overlap in UTC, a program instant does not identify a unique segment of that
stream, so no unique pairing exists and the request fails with 422.
